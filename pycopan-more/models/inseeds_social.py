"""
Social sub-component of the InSEEDS model.
This does not inlude any communication to LPJmL via the pycoupler, but can be 
regarded as a first step towards coupled runs.

Based on the exploit model, inluding novel decision-making dynamics
on tha basis of the Theory of Planned behaviour (TPB)

Conceptualization by Luana Schwarz, implementation based on Ronja Hotz' 
Exploit model MOL CC SN, with adjustments by Luana Schwarz.

These are placeholders and must be adjusted as needed. For further details see
